Skyrim doesn't allow you to select a character to load. There are just a hundreds of save-files, and that's disappointing.

This tool provides you a list of your characters by scanning "Saves" directory.
Select one with doubleclick - Skyrim will be started, and "Continue" menu item will load last save of selected char.
Don't forget to edit config.py at first.

Tool just makes a copy of selected char's last save-file, so Skyrim treats that copy as latest save - and "Continue" will load it.
